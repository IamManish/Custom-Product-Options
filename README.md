# Custom-Product-Options
Magento 2.2 Extention for Extended Custom Product Options supports Image Uploads, Swatch Colors, and Selector Grouping.

To Install:

Place The Evil folder inside the 'app' folder of a Magento 2.2+ installation.

Go to Command Line and in the root folder of Magento, enter 'php bin/magento setup:upgrade'

Now log into the Admin (CMS). Go to 'Catalog > Products' , Select or Add a Product > Edit, go to 'Customizable Options', Add Options > Option Type = Dropdown (now you can see the Extended Custom Options :)

I hope the instructions are good enough. You might have to reload the Product Detail Edit page the first time because of the Caching.

Let me know if you have prolems.
